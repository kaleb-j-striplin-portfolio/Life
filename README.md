# Life
Rust implementation of Conway's Game of Life for the 5x5 LED array on the Microbit V2

### Run

Plug in your MicroBit v2

```rust
cargo embed --release
``` 

### Specs 

* The program runs the game at 10 frames per second (updates once per 100ms).

* The program starts with a random board.

* While the A button is held, the board is re-randomized every frame.

* Otherwise, when the B button is not ignored and is pressed, the board is “complemented”: every “on” cell is turned “off” and every “off” cell is turned “on”. The B button is then ignored for 5 frames (0.5s).

* Otherwise, if the program reaches a state where all cells on the board are off, the program waits 5 frames (0.5s). If it has not received a button press, it then starts with a new random board.

* Otherwise, normal Life steps are taken.
